## Insights
- The `CommentsController` class is annotated with `@RestController` and `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, indicating that it's a REST controller and it should enable auto-configuration of the Spring Application Context.
- The `secret` variable is injected using the `@Value` annotation, which indicates that the value of this variable should be fetched from the application's configuration properties.
- The `comments`, `createComment`, and `deleteComment` methods are mapped to the `/comments` endpoint for GET, POST, and DELETE HTTP methods respectively. They all require an `x-auth-token` header for user authentication.
- The `CommentRequest` class is a simple data structure that holds the `username` and `body` of a comment.
- The `BadRequest` and `ServerError` classes are custom exceptions that are thrown when there's a bad request or server error respectively. They are annotated with `@ResponseStatus` to indicate the HTTP status code that should be returned when these exceptions are thrown.

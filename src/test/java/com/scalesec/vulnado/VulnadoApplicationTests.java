The issue reported by SonarQube is related to the lack of assertions in the test case. In the test method `contextLoads()`, there are no assertions to check the expected behavior of the code under test. 

To fix this issue, we need to add an assertion to the test case. However, without knowing what the `contextLoads()` method is supposed to do, it's hard to suggest a specific assertion. 

A common assertion in a contextLoads test in a Spring Boot application is to assert that the application context loads successfully. This can be done by autowiring the ApplicationContext in the test and then asserting that it is not null.

Here is the code fix suggestion:

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;

@Autowired
private ApplicationContext ctx;

@Test
public void contextLoads() {
    assertNotNull(ctx);
}
```

Here is the ContentEditor operation:

```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation": "INSERT",
      "lineNumber": 3,
      "content": "import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull;"
    },
    {
      "operation": "INSERT",
      "lineNumber": 4,
      "content": "import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;"
    },
    {
      "operation": "INSERT",
      "lineNumber": 5,
      "content": "import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;"
    },
    {
      "operation": "INSERT",
      "lineNumber": 11,
      "content": "@Autowired"
    },
    {
      "operation": "INSERT",
      "lineNumber": 12,
      "content": "private ApplicationContext ctx;"
    },
    {
      "operation": "REPLACE",
      "lineNumber": 13,
      "content": "public void contextLoads() {"
    },
    {
      "operation": "INSERT",
      "lineNumber": 14,
      "content": "assertNotNull(ctx);"
    }
  ]
}
```

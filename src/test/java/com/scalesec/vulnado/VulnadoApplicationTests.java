The issue reported by SonarQube is related to the lack of assertions in the test case at line 13. In order to fix this issue, we need to add an assertion to the test case. Since the test case is named `contextLoads()`, it seems like it's supposed to test if the application context loads correctly. 

A common way to test this in a Spring Boot application is to Autowire the ApplicationContext in the test and then check if it's not null. 

Let's add the necessary changes to the code:

- Import the ApplicationContext and Autowired annotations
- Autowire the ApplicationContext in the test class
- Add an assertion in the `contextLoads()` test to check if the ApplicationContext is not null

Here is the ContentEditor operation to perform these changes:

```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation": "INSERT",
      "lineNumber": 3,
      "content": "import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;"
    },
    {
      "operation": "INSERT",
      "lineNumber": 4,
      "content": "import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;"
    },
    {
      "operation": "INSERT",
      "lineNumber": 11,
      "content": "@Autowired"
    },
    {
      "operation": "INSERT",
      "lineNumber": 12,
      "content": "private ApplicationContext context;"
    },
    {
      "operation": "INSERT",
      "lineNumber": 14,
      "content": "assertNotNull(context);"
    },
    {
      "operation": "INSERT",
      "lineNumber": 3,
      "content": "import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull;"
    }
  ]
}
```

This will add the necessary imports, Autowire the ApplicationContext and add an assertion to the test case.

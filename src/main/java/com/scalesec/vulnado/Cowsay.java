Based on the REMARKS section, let's start with the first issue:

- [6]: 
	- [ISSUE](java:S1118): Add a private constructor to hide the implicit public one.

This issue is about the class `Cowsay` which doesn't have a constructor. By default, Java provides a public no-arg constructor which is not good practice for utility classes. We should add a private constructor to prevent instantiation.

Let's use the ContentEditor function to add a private constructor after line 6.

```json
{
  "operation": "INSERT",
  "lineNumber": 7,
  "content": "private Cowsay() {}"
}
```

Next, let's move to the second issue:

- [10]: 
	- [ISSUE](java:S106): Replace this use of System.out by a logger.

This issue is about the use of `System.out.println(cmd);` which is not a good practice. We should replace it with a logger. 

First, we need to add the import for the logger at line 5.

```json
{
  "operation": "INSERT",
  "lineNumber": 5,
  "content": "import java.util.logging.Logger;"
}
```

Then, we need to declare a logger instance at line 7.

```json
{
  "operation": "INSERT",
  "lineNumber": 7,
  "content": "private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(Cowsay.class.getName());"
}
```

Finally, we replace the `System.out.println(cmd);` with a logger at line 10.

```json
{
  "operation": "REPLACE",
  "lineNumber": 10,
  "content": "LOGGER.info(cmd);"
}
```

For the remaining issues, they are security hotspots and need to be handled carefully. I would suggest to review the command execution process and make sure it's secure. Also, the debug feature (e.printStackTrace()) should be deactivated before delivering the code in production.
